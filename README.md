## Features
- ### Collaborative prompting
  @ the bot and it will reply to your message. Reply to the bot's message to continue from that point. Build conversations with reply chains!
 
  You can reply to any of the bot's messages to continue from any point. Or reply to your friend's message and @ the bot to ask a question about it. There are no limits to this functionality.

  Additionally:
  - Back-to-back messages from the same user are automatically chained together. Just reply to the latest one and the bot will see all of them.
  - You can seamlessly move any conversation into a [thread](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ). Just create a thread from any message and @ the bot inside to continue.

- ### Choose your LLM
  Supports models from [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), [Mistral API](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme), [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and many more thanks to [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).

  Also supports:
  - [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)
  - [Jan](https://jan.ai)
  - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)

- ### Vision support
  The bot can see image attachments when you choose a vision model.

- ### Streamed responses
  The bot's responses are dynamically generated and turn green when complete.

### And more...
- Easily set a custom personality
- DM the bot for private access (no @ required)
- User identity aware
- Fully asynchronous
- 1 Python file, ~200 lines of code

3. Run the bot:
```bash
python llmcord.py
```

## Notes
- Vision support is currently limited to **gpt-4-vision-preview** from OpenAI API. Support for local vision models like llava is planned.

- Only models from OpenAI API are user identity aware (excluding **gpt-4-vision-preview** for now). This is because only OpenAI API supports the **name** property in the user message object. I tried the alternate approach of prepending user's names in the message body but this doesn't seem to work well with all models.

- PRs are welcome :)
