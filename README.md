# Features
### REPLY-BASED CHAT HISTORY
Mention (@) the bot and it will reply to you. Reply to any message to continue the conversation from that point. 
The chat history is built dynamically from reply chains.

### STREAMED RESPONSES
The bot's replies start generating instantly rather than having to wait longer for one big chunk.
> As of writing this no other GPT Discord bot has successfully implemented this. Feel free to prove me wrong :)

### AND MORE...
- Easily set a custom personality
- User identity aware
- Fully asynchronous
- 1 Python file, ~100 lines of code

# Instructions
> Before you start, install Python and clone this git repo.
1. Install Python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create _.env_ from _.env.example_ and set it up:

| Setting | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| DISCORD\_BOT_TOKEN | Create a new Discord application at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and generate a token under the "Bot" tab. Also enable "message content intent". |
| OPENAI\_API_KEY | Generate an OpenAI API key at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You must also add a payment method to your OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).|
| GPT_MODEL | Choose between "gpt-4-1106-preview", "gpt-4", "gpt-4-32k", "gpt-3.5-turbo", or "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k". More info on OpenAI models: [platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) |
| CUSTOM\_SYSTEM_PROMPT | Write practically anything you want to customize the bot's behavior! |

3. Invite the bot to your Discord server with this URL (replace <CLIENT_ID> with your Discord application's client ID found under the "OAuth2" tab):
```plaintext
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&permissions=412317273088&scope=bot
```

4. Run the bot:
```bash
python gpt-discord.py
```
